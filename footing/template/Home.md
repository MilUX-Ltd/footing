# {{pack_name}}

Welcome to your Footing vault.

This is the landing page for everything that follows. Use it as a daily entry point and a place to surface what matters most.

## Where to start

- **`Context/{{pack_owner}}.md`** — your operator profile. Check it reads well and revise.
- **`Context/{{pack_org}}.md`** — your organisation page. Same.
- **Read the Guides.** Every folder has a `<Folder Name> Guide.md` at its root. Knowledge Guide, Operations Guide, Context Guide, and CRM Guide are the load-bearing ones.

## Today

Open today's daily note: `Daily/{{install_date}}.md` (or whichever day you're on).

## How this vault works

See `CLAUDE.md` at the root for the architecture and working conventions. The short version: research and curation upstream of execution, with deliberate promotion of agent-produced output into the canonical vault.
