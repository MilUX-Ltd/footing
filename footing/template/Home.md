# {{pack_name}}

Welcome to your Footing vault.

This is the landing page for everything that follows. Use it as a daily entry point and a place to surface what matters most.

## Where to start

- **[[Getting Started - Your First Week]]** — one small win a day for your first week. Start here.
- **[[How to Use This Vault]]** — the four working habits that make the system compound: brief it like an intern, describe processes so they can be automated, watch for repeatable patterns, review the work and the working.
- **`Context/{{pack_owner}}.md`** — your operator profile. Check it reads well and revise.
- **`Context/{{pack_org}}.md`** — your organisation page. Same.
- **Read the Guides.** Every folder has a `<Folder Name> Guide.md` at its root. Knowledge Guide, Operations Guide, Context Guide, and CRM Guide are the load-bearing ones.

## Today

Open today's daily note: `Daily/{{install_date}}.md` (or whichever day you're on).

> [!info] The panels below are live queries. They need the free **Dataview** community plugin: Settings → Community plugins → Browse → Dataview → Install and Enable. Until then they display as code; once Dataview is on, they fill themselves as your vault grows. Empty panels just mean no pages of that kind yet.

## How this vault works

See `CLAUDE.md` at the root for the architecture and working conventions. The short version: research and curation upstream of execution, with deliberate promotion of agent-produced output into the canonical vault.
