# Rules

The numbered rule list for this vault. Every rule has a stable identifier (R-01, R-02, ...). Numbers are not reused, even if a rule is later deprecated.

Footing ships with a baseline set of rules; everything below is the default. Add your own rules below the shipped set as your operating model develops.

## R-01 — Escape the pipe in table-cell wikilinks

In Obsidian table cells, the pipe character separates columns. A wikilink with display text uses the pipe too. The two conflict.

When placing a wikilink with display text inside a markdown table, escape the pipe with a backslash:

```markdown
| [[CRM/contacts/active contacts/Jane Smith\|Jane Smith]] | Acme Corp | jane@example.com |
```

Outside table cells, the unescaped pipe is fine. This rule applies wherever a wikilink with display text sits inside a table.

## R-02 — ISO dates everywhere

Dates use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. In frontmatter, in filenames, in body text. Avoid regional formats like `DD/MM/YYYY` or `MM-DD-YYYY`. Sorting and search both depend on the convention.

For daily notes the filename is the date itself: `2026-05-20.md`. For event notes the date prefixes the filename: `2026-05-20 <Event Name>.md`.

## R-03 — Frontmatter on every page

Every Markdown page in this vault carries YAML frontmatter. At minimum:

```yaml
---
type: <page type>
---
```

The `type` field is non-negotiable. It lets agents and queries operate on the page reliably. Other fields are page-type-specific; see the per-folder Guide for what each page type carries.

## R-04 — Entities live in CRM, maps live in Intelligence

`CRM/` holds entities you have or might have a working relationship with: contacts, organisations, networks. Each entity has one canonical home page. Relationship knowledge accumulates there.

`Intelligence/sector-landscape/` (and similar Intelligence subfolders) holds maps of the wider sector: frameworks, portals, programmes, public reference content. These pages are not entity homes; they point at CRM entries.

Test: if the page is about one entity and carries your engagement context, it belongs in `CRM/`. If the page describes a market mechanism or public landscape feature, it belongs in `Intelligence/`.

## R-05 — Rebrands keep one canonical page

When an organisation, programme, or framework is renamed, the canonical page in the vault adopts the new name. The old name is preserved in frontmatter as `former_name:` and as a body-text callout. Search continues to hit the old name through frontmatter and body text; the canonical anchor is the new identity. No parallel pages for old and new.

This matters most for organisations that reorganise or rebrand on a multi-year cadence, larger clients, suppliers, and sector bodies with corporate structures that shift over time. The pattern absorbs reorganisations without breaking inbound wikilinks to children.

---

## R-06 — Promotion is deliberate

Content drafted by an agent or pulled in from elsewhere (an outputs queue, a transcript, a research scrape) becomes canonical vault knowledge only via an explicit promotion step. Promotion is a decision, not an automatic action.

See `CLAUDE.md` § Promotion Pattern for the three mechanical steps.

## Adding new rules

When you add a new rule, take the next R-NN number. Write the rule statement in one line, followed by a paragraph of context explaining why. If the rule emerged from a hypothesis (see `hypotheses.md`), reference the hypothesis that justified promotion.

If a rule is later superseded, mark it deprecated rather than deleting. Numbers are not reused.
