# MilUX

> **Footing maintainer.** MilUX is the consultancy that built Footing (and its defence-sector sibling, Foothold) and the network entry point for everyone who installs it. Public-facing reference profile.

## Company Details

- **Strapline:** From Insight to Impact.
- **Website:** [milux.co.uk](https://milux.co.uk)
- **Sector:** Defence-focused user-centred design consultancy.
- **Size:** Micro SME.
- **Founder:** [[CRM/contacts/active contacts/Matt Odell|Matt Odell]].

## What MilUX does

MilUX is a defence-focused user-centred design consultancy. It combines sector understanding, user-centred design, product and service thinking, delivery pragmatism, and training into a single practice.

MilUX works across leadership, delivery, marketing, service development, training, community building, and client-facing engagement, rather than staying inside a narrow functional lane. Its core client base is defence-sector, but the practice underneath, AI-assisted second-brain design and adoption, is general-purpose. Footing is that practice's output for any established business, not just defence.

## Capabilities and services

- **User-centred design applied to procurement and capability development.**
- **Kanban-based delivery for distributed teams.** Kanban University Accredited Kanban Trainer (AKT) on staff.
- **AI-assisted second-brain design and adoption.** Cowork plus Obsidian as the working substrate. Footing and Foothold are outputs of this practice.

## Footing context

MilUX built Footing to short-circuit the months a business typically loses figuring out how to put AI to work properly and building a working knowledge system from scratch. The pack's structure, conventions, and skills come from MilUX's own working vault. This is also the canonical example of a "supplier" page in a Footing pack: a service provider you might buy from, not a customer or a competitor.

## How MilUX runs its AI operating model

The vault you're holding is the memory layer. It only becomes a working operating model once Claude can act on what's in it and reach the rest of the tools your business runs on. Here's how MilUX has it wired up. None of this is required to use Footing. It's offered as one worked example of where this can go, and roughly what it costs at each step.

### The pattern

[Claude](https://claude.com) does the thinking. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) holds the long-term memory. Cowork is where Claude and Matt sit at the same machine. Connectors give Claude hands into the other tools the business runs on, and skills are the small reusable instructions that turn a recurring task into something Claude can just do.

Matt curates. An agent called Argos, running inside Cowork, takes on the legwork. Nothing reaches a client without a human edit.

### Starting point: about £15 a month

You can run a working version of this with very little. A Claude Pro subscription at roughly £15 a month gives you Cowork, the file tools, and enough capability to drive the vault. Obsidian itself is free. [Composio](https://composio.dev) is free for personal use and can connect Claude to a long list of SaaS tools. That's the entry point. Everything below is an upgrade Matt found a reason to add.

### What MilUX connects to

**Voice and writing.** Matt talks to the computer more than he types. [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai) handles dictation across every app for about £15 a month, so a thought becomes text without opening anything. [Speechify](https://speechify.com) reads long documents back at about £10 a month, useful for reviewing drafts on the move. [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) sits on top of everything as a line-editor for about £5 a month.

**Meetings.** [Otter AI](https://otter.ai) joins meetings, records them, transcribes them, and tags speakers, for about £15 a month. Once Matt has tagged speakers in Otter's UI, Argos pulls the transcript via the Otter MCP, files it into [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) alongside the rest of the event material, and updates the relevant event page in the vault. This is how a one-hour conversation becomes a searchable record by the time Matt is on the train home.

**Reference library.** DEVONthink holds years of captured PDFs, web clippings, slide notes, and meeting transcripts for about £19 a month equivalent. Argos can ground its research in MilUX's archive rather than the open web, which matters when the open web doesn't carry the answer.

**Connector platform.** Composio is a general-purpose connector layer that can reach a long list of SaaS tools, and it is free for MilUX's current usage. MilUX uses it for one job today: posting expenses and reading transactions in [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com), the accounting system of record. Gmail goes through Unipile instead, and Google Workspace via its own dedicated connector. The point of having Composio sitting there is that the next FreeAgent-shaped problem is a configuration change, not a build.

**Messaging.** [Unipile](https://www.unipile.com) gives Claude a single account that covers four channels: LinkedIn, Personal WhatsApp, WhatsApp Business, and Gmail. About $49 a month. It is how Argos reads inboxes, drafts replies, and pulls LinkedIn conversation history into the vault without Matt forwarding anything.

**[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) (Jira and Confluence).** About £29 a month for a single seat. Used for projects with clients who already live in Atlassian, and for the documentation that has to sit somewhere the customer can see.

**Coordination.** [Businessmap](https://businessmap.io) is the Kanban board that sits above every piece of agent work. About £10 a seat per month. Every card carries the comments and links that let Matt audit what was done. If you would like a demo and a three-month trial, get in touch with Matt. [Notion](https://www.notion.com) at about £15 a month is the shared output surface where agents land work for review before promotion into the vault.

**Vault sync.** [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) at $4 a month for a single user keeps the vault current across machines. Optional, but cheaper than the alternative of a git workflow if you're working alone.

### A handful of named skills

A skill is a vault-stored instruction that turns a recurring job into a single conversational ask. These are the ones that earn their keep most often at MilUX:

- **EV mileage claim.** Pick a destination; the skill calculates miles, applies the HMRC AER of 4p per mile, and posts the expense straight into FreeAgent via Composio.
- **Thank new connections.** Scans the week's new LinkedIn connections, drafts a short thank-you with Matt's intro Calendly link, and queues them for review before any send.
- **Daily comms catch-up.** 09:15 Monday to Friday: Gmail, Slack, Calendar, Businessmap, all in one place by the time Matt sits down.
- **Late payment reminder.** Generates three escalating chase emails, with statutory interest calculated against the live Bank of England base rate.
- **Send email.** Every Gmail send goes through this skill, which assembles the body, the agent disclosure, and the legal signature in the right order so nothing leaves Matt's account half-dressed.
- **Meeting prep.** Given a meeting in the calendar, builds a one-page brief: who is in the room, prior context from the vault and DEVONthink, the live LinkedIn snapshot, and the three things worth raising.
- **LinkedIn writer.** Drafts posts in Matt's voice from a rough idea or a transcript fragment, with the editorial rules and forbidden vocabulary built in.
- **Newsletter writer.** Turns the week's vault output into a candidate newsletter draft.
- **Book train ticket.** Reads the journey out of the calendar and produces a Trainline-ready prompt with class, time window, and railcard already in.
- **Add contact.** Researches a new person across LinkedIn, Gmail, and DEVONthink and drops a populated CRM page into the vault.

### What a running setup costs

Three rough tiers, all in monthly equivalent:

- **Free or close to it.** Obsidian, Composio's free tier, the standard Claude subscription. Around £15 a month, the cost of Claude Pro alone.
- **Working setup.** Add Wispr Flow, Otter, DEVONthink, Unipile, Businessmap, Notion, Obsidian Sync. Roughly £100 to £150 a month, depending on which of those you actually use.
- **MilUX's current shape.** Everything above plus Atlassian, [Calendly](https://calendly.com), [Slack](https://slack.com), [Zoom](https://zoom.us), [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) seats, and the marketing tools (LinkedIn company page, [Miro](https://miro.com), [Canva](https://www.canva.com)). Roughly £400 to £500 a month, before the Claude plan.

Start where the value is obvious. Add the next thing when a job you do every week is taking too long.
