## What this is, and is not

For segmenting an existing **user** base by behaviour and need. It is the companion to `market-segments`, which segments the **customer** market by purpose. Use this when you have user feedback or usage data and want to find the distinct groups inside it; use `market-segments` when you are mapping who would hire the offering and why. The two should produce compatible segments: a user segment sits inside a purpose-segment.

## The key move

Ground the segmentation in the job each user group is doing and the conditions they do it under, not in job title or department. The user judges the offering on the experience of using it in their real day-to-day work, so segment on that. Keep the user segments tied to the customer-side segmentation so the people who select can see the users they are selecting for.

## Method

1. **Prepare the data:** feedback, interviews, support tickets, usage logs, surveys.
2. **Extract behaviour:** usage modes, journeys, proficiency, how the thing fits the wider workflow.
3. **Analyse needs:** the job each user is doing, the outcomes wanted, the pains.
4. **Cluster** into distinct, non-overlapping segments by behaviour and need.
5. **Validate** for coherence and actionability.
6. **Characterise** each with representative quotes.

## For each segment (minimum 3)

- **Name and overview:** a descriptive identifier, an estimated size, a one-line characterisation.
- **Behaviour:** how they use the thing; the journey; proficiency; workflow integration.
- **Purpose and motivation:** the job, the outcome, the context, what success looks like.
- **Needs and pains:** unmet needs, obstacles, workarounds, severity.
- **Current fit:** how well the thing serves them now; what they value; the gaps; churn risk.
- **What would improve fit:** the change that would move the experience, and what it serves.
- **Prioritisation:** strategic importance against ease of serving; invest, maintain, or de-prioritise.

## Notes

- Behaviour and need, not demographics. Quote real users.
- Flag segments thin in the data.
- Pairs with `market-segments`, `user-personas`, `customer-journey-map`.
