## What this is, and when it applies

Synthesis of a body of feedback into segments, sentiment and satisfaction. It needs a real corpus (reviews, surveys, support tickets, social listening) to be worth running; on a handful of comments it is a hypothesis, not a measurement.

## Method

1. **Ingest** all feedback sources; inventory what you have.
2. **Identify segments:** at least three, by behaviour and need (see `user-segmentation`), not demographics.
3. **Thematic analysis:** recurring themes, pains and positives per segment.
4. **Sentiment scoring:** an overall score (-1 to +1) per segment, with the drivers and detractors.
5. **Impact:** prioritise by frequency, severity and consequence.
6. **Synthesise** segment profiles.

## Output, per segment

Profile and size; jobs to be done; sentiment score and satisfaction (read as how well the offering fits what the segment selects on); top positive themes; top pains with quotes; product-segment fit and churn risk; two to three highest-impact recommendations.

## Notes

- Ground every finding in the feedback; cite sources; flag thin samples.
- Keep feedback data within your own data-handling boundaries.
- Pairs with `user-segmentation`, `user-personas`, `customer-journey-map`.
