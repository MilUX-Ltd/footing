# Capabilities and Services Guide

## Purpose

`Capabilities and Services/` is where your organisation's offers and operational functions live. Two clean halves: what you sell to customers, and what you run internally to keep the business working.

Distinct from `Marketing/`, which holds the published outputs (LinkedIn posts, case studies, newsletter content) that the marketing function produces. The function lives here; the artefacts live there.

## Structure

```

    └── <Other internal services>.md
```

**Customer-Facing Services.** What your organisation sells. One file per service offer, named for the service (`Training and Coaching Service.md`, `Capability Audit Service.md`). The page carries the offer's positioning, scope, deliverables, pricing approach, and who it's for.

**Internal Services.** Operational functions you run internally to make the business work. Content production, compliance, finance, recruiting, sales operations. One file per function. Some functions are load-bearing for other parts of the vault (`Content Pillars.md` and `Content Creation Workflow.md` feed `Marketing/`).

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: service
status: active | paused | retired
created: YYYY-MM-DD
customer-facing: true | false
last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

`customer-facing: true` for files under `Customer-Facing Services/`. `customer-facing: false` for files under `Internal Services/`.

## Add discipline

**Adding a customer-facing service.** Create the page when the offer is real enough to sell. Include the value proposition, target customer, scope, deliverables, pricing approach, and how it gets delivered. If the offer is still being shaped, capture it in `Ideas/` first and promote to a service page when it stabilises.

**Adding an internal service.** Add a page when an operational function becomes a repeatable thing rather than ad-hoc work. The test: are you doing this regularly enough that codifying the approach would save time? If yes, it's an internal service.

**Naming.** Services get `<Name> Service.md`. Internal functions get descriptive names that match how you'd refer to them in conversation (`Content Pillars.md`, not `pillars.md`).

**Retiring a service.** Set `status: retired`, keep the page for institutional memory. Don't delete unless the offer never existed in practice.

## Canonical example

The shipped Footing defaults include `Internal Services/Content Pillars.md` and `Internal Services/Content Creation Workflow.md` as the canonical pattern for an internal service that feeds another part of the vault. For customer-facing, populate your first real offer and the structure will be self-evident.
